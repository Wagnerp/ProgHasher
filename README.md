ProgHasher
==========

Basic file hashing program, multi-threaded

This project is just like "Everything". I started on this project before Everything released but was unable to complete it before "Everything" was released. The main aim of this program was to create full file system file executable lists which can then be used for programs like like "Launchy" or for search, like "Everything", at the same time.
