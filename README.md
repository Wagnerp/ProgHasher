ProgHasher
==========

Basic file hashing program, multi-threaded

This project is just like "Everything". I started on this project before Everything released but was unable to complete it before they released theirs. The main aim of this program was to perform create full file system hashes and command lists that allowed it to behave like "Launchy" and "Everything" together, depeding on the usage.
